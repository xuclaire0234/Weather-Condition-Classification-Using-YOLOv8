# Weather-Condition-Classification-Using-YOLOv8
This project involves building a weather condition classification model using a pre-trained YOLOv8 network and a custom image dataset. The goal is to classify images into categories such as "snowy," "rainy," and "foggy" by leveraging YOLOv8's lightweight and efficient architecture.

## 2. Dataset Preparation

### Dataset Organization
The dataset is structured into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The split ratios are:
- **Training:** 50%
- **Validation:** 30%
- **Testing:** 20%

Each subset is organized into subdirectories corresponding to their respective categories.

### Process Overview
- **Data Extraction:** Extract image files from the root directory.
- **Splitting:** Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- **File Organization:** Copy images into their respective subdirectories for seamless integration with YOLO's training pipeline.

## 3. Model Training

### YOLOv8 Classifier
- **Pre-trained Model:** YOLOv8n (nano version) was selected for its efficiency in lightweight applications.
- **Input Size:** Images were resized to 64x64 for faster training.
- **Epochs:** The model was trained for 100 epochs to ensure convergence.

## 4. Visualization of Training Metrics

### Loss vs. Epochs
- **Training Loss:** Indicates the model's performance on the training dataset.
- **Validation Loss:** Measures the model's generalization ability on unseen data.

### Validation Accuracy vs. Epochs
- The accuracy metric evaluates the percentage of correctly classified images in the validation set.

### Key Observations:
- Gradual reduction in training and validation loss.
- Increasing validation accuracy demonstrates improved model performance and generalization.

## 5. Model Evaluation

### Test Predictions
The trained model was tested on unseen images from the testing set. It predicted weather conditions with probabilities for each class. The final prediction was based on the class with the highest confidence score.

### Results:
- **Class Labels:** Snowy, Rainy, Foggy.
- **Confidence Scores:** The model outputs a confidence score for each class, providing insights into its decision-making.
