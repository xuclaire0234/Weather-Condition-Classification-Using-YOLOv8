# Weather-Condition-Classification-Using-YOLOv8
This project involves building a weather condition classification model using a pre-trained YOLOv8 network and a custom image dataset. The goal is to classify images into categories such as "snowy," "rainy," and "foggy" by leveraging YOLOv8's lightweight and efficient architecture.
